This is a repository that contains the diagnosis and prognosis scripts presented in the paper "Diagnostics and Prognostics of Multi-Mode Failure Scenarios in Miter Gates Using Multiple Data Sources and a Dynamic Bayesian Network"

The diagnosis script may take hours to run if you want to get good results with a larger amount of particles.

The prognosis part can also be time-consuming if simulation time at each time step is set too large.
